The system suggests blog post ideas based on trending keywords in your niche, helping you create content that's both valuable to your readers and optimized for search engines. This approach ensures your blog attracts the right audience while maintaining relevance in your field.

Recommend titles that attract clicks and match your niche by analyzing what works in your specific industry. The AI considers factors like search volume, competition, and user intent to suggest titles that are both compelling and SEO-friendly.

Once you choose a topic, click **"Generate Draft"**, and Forged's AI writer will create a comprehensive blog post structure that follows proven content creation principles.

The AI structures your post with an introduction that hooks readers, clear headings that guide them through your content, and a conclusion that reinforces your key points and encourages action. This structure ensures your content is engaging and easy to follow.

Write high-quality content with natural language that sounds human and authentic. The AI adapts to your writing style and expertise, creating content that reflects your unique voice and perspective.

Suggest calls-to-action (CTAs), quotes, and examples that enhance your content and encourage reader engagement. The AI identifies natural opportunities to include these elements without making your content feel overly promotional.

Internal linking to other blog posts or course pages is automatically suggested, helping you create a web of related content that improves both user experience and search engine understanding of your site's structure.

Real-time readability and structure feedback helps you optimize your content for both search engines and human readers. The AI analyzes factors like sentence length, paragraph structure, and overall content flow to ensure maximum engagement.

It even auto-generates SEO-friendly titles and slugs that are optimized for both click-through rates and search rankings. Meta descriptions are crafted to accurately summarize your content while incorporating relevant keywords and creating compelling reasons for searchers to click through.

Open Graph previews for social media are automatically created, ensuring your content looks professional and engaging when shared on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
